# Engage in a conversation with an AI agent

Suppose you work for the fictional Contoso organization, and you need to submit an expense claim for a recent business trip. The company has created an AI Agent to help employees with expense policies and claims. AI agents are more than just generative AI enabled chatbots. They can also perform actions on your behalf, using access to data and tools to complete tasks. In this case, the agent can generate and submit an expense claim on your behalf.

> In this simulated app, the agent’s understanding is limited. A real generative AI agent typically has much more versatility in understanding and generating language.

1. In a web browser, open the [Expense chat assistant](https://aka.ms/expenses-agent) app at [`https://aka.ms/expenses-agent`](https://aka.ms/expenses-agent).
2. In the chat interface, enter a prompt, such as `Hello`, and review the response.
3. Try another prompt, such as `What can you do?`, and review the response.
4. Try selecting one of the sample prompts, such as `How much can I spend on a meal?` and entering it. Then review the response.
5. Try entering a variation on that prompt - for example, `What's the limit for food?` or `What about a taxi?` and note that the agent can interpret your input appropriately as meaning the same thing as asking how much you can spend on a meal or cab ride.
6. Carry on asking questions about expense limits for things like hotels and airfares.
7. Enter a prompt asking how to submit an expense claim (for example, `How do I submit a claim?`).
8. When the agent asks if you’d like it to submit a claim on your behalf, enter `yes` (or `OK`, `sure`, or similar).
9. When asked for details of the claim, enter some details like `I need to claim $70 for dinner and $25 for a taxi ride.`.

> The agent should respond indicating that it has taken action on your behalf.
