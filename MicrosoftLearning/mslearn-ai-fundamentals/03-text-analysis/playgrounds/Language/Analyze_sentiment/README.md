Disappointing Stay at The City Hotel
The City Hotel, London
9/5/2018
My experience at The City Hotel in London was far from pleasant. The constant noise from nearby train tracks made it nearly impossible to sleep, with vibrations felt throughout the building. The rooms were outdated, dusty, and poorly maintained—dripping faucets, squeaky beds, and broken fixtures were just the beginning. Sound insulation was nonexistent, so every conversation from neighboring rooms was clearly audible. While the location near public transport was convenient and the staff were friendly, these positives couldn't make up for the overall discomfort and lack of value. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a restful or enjoyable stay.

3. Select **Run**. Review the output.
