A memorable stay at the Hôtel d'Ville City Hall, Paris 9/5/2018 I had a great stay at the Hôtel d'Ville in Paris.
The location is ideal, right in the heart of the city, making it easy to discover the main sights.
The staff was warm, professional and always willing to help.
The room was clean, comfortable and well equipped, with a charming view of the Parisian streets.
The breakfast was varied and delicious, perfect to start the day.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an authentic and enjoyable Parisian experience.
