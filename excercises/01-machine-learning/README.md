# Explore Machine Learning

In this exercise, you’ll use a lightweight application to train and evaluate machine learning models. You’ll then deploy and test the trained model.

This exercise should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

## Download data

In this exercise, you’ll use data files to train multiple types of machine learning model.

1. Download [ml-data.zip](https://aka.ms/mslearn-ai-data) from [`https://aka.ms/mslearn-ai-data`](https://aka.ms/mslearn-ai-data) to your local computer.
1. Extract the downloaded archive in a local folder to see the files it contains. These files contain data suitable for training machine learning models.

## Train models

1. [Train a regression model](./regression/)
2. [Train a classification model](./classification/)
3. [Train a clustering model](./clustering/)

## Summary

In this exercise, you trained three different kinds of machine learning model, reviewing relevant evaluation metrics for each model and using them to predict new values.

While the tool you used in this exercise is basic, it uses tried and tested algorithms and the Scikit-Learn framework for Python to train and evaluate machine learning models based on data. You can use it with your own data if you want to explore further.

In real-world, enterprise scenarios, a more scalable, cloud-based machine learning platform, such as Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, offers a comprehensive solution for training and managing machine learning models to power AI-informed decision making.
